## A quick background
I have a broad background which includes artistic, business, software, and speaking/writing experience. I am both technical and aesthetic, an engineer as well as a graphic designer. The combination of these experiences and skills lets me both design and build beautiful and compelling things. Whether those things are innovative user interfaces, compelling PowerPoint presentations, or breakthrough advertising materials, the result is always the same: a logical, usable, and organized layout; easily understandable copy; and, always, a beautiful look and feel.

Why does that matter? 

Because it's not enough to just build a great product, or provide a wonderful service. It also matters how you introduce that producct or service to potential customers, influencers, partners, and others. When your momma said "first impressions matter," she wasn't just talking about combing your hair and wearing a clean shirt. The presentations we give, the advertising materials we produce, and the actual look, feel, and ease of usability of the products we offer have as much to do with building acceptance as any actual features and functions. 

My strength--my superpower, you might say--is being able to create products and promotional materials that speak to buyers. It's really true, looks matter.

## Lotus Notes

Prior to joining IBM, I was one of two owners of one of the earliest Lotus Notes Business Partners, Teamwork Solutions. These days, Notes is widely criticized for its outdated user interface and yet there is no reason Lotus Notes applications have to look bad. Shown here are four examples I built as far back as 2005.

## PowerPoint presentations

Shown above and below are a variety slides from a range of PowerPoint presentations I built to promote our products at IBM. Throughout, you'll find simple, compelling graphics with easy-to-understand copy.

## Customer-focused demos

In 2017 IBM added the IBM Connections Engagement Center (ICEC) to our list of offerings. It was a portal-like front-end for IBM Connections that offered users the ability to create and insert their own CSS and JavaScript to make the pages match their corporate standards (or just to make it look better). 

Above and below are three examples of customized ICEC demonstration pages I created using the same tools by leveraging the inherent capabilities of the platform and my own extensive knowledge of CSS and JavaScript.

## Advertising flyers

IBM's Kenexa brand of talent management products had very little in the way of printed promotional materials worth showing to customers. At the request of one of my sellers I wrote, designed, and created the two flyers shown above and the 4-page flyer shown below (only 3 pages shown here).

## Connections Customizer wild examples

![Image](21-CustomizerYellow.jpg)

IBM Connections Customizer is an add-in product to IBM Connections which makes it possible for customers to add their own CSS and JavaScript to Connections pages to change the way they look and act. These examples were built as extreme examples of the kinds of changes that could be made...and were intentionally on the wild side.

## DQL Explorer

![Image](DQLExplorer.jpg)

The DQL Explorer was a joint project between [Dimitri Prosper](https://dprosper.github.io) and myself from our time at IBM. Dimitri built the back end, while I was responsible for all aspects of the user interface, both look-and-feel and functionality. Built as a web-based UI using React and an IBM Notes-based database for storage and configuration, note that this is not the typical throw-anything-together-just-to-show-it-can-work UI of most proofs-of-concept. Instead, the user interface is clean, well laid-out, and easy to understand. Complex functionality under the covers is exposed as a simple, easy to use, interface.

You can watch a [DQL Explorer Demo](https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cfw_6Wvk8c8) I recorded some years ago.
